Examining hw1.c

FINAL RESULTS:

hw1.c:19:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Consider using strcpy_s, strncpy, or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily
  misused).
hw1.c:20:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Consider using strcpy_s, strncpy, or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily
  misused).
hw1.c:21:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Consider using strcpy_s, strncpy, or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily
  misused).
hw1.c:31:  [4] (shell) system:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.
hw1.c:18:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119:CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
